## Description

This is a minimalistic and extensible [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) API that renders a Histogram. It is written in JavaScript without dependency on third-party libraries.

## Features
* The histogram is accurate no more than 2 decimal on x-axis.
* It accepts positive and negative floating points as input up to any decimal points.
* The histogram generates dynamic numbers of bars based on [The Rice Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) is presented as a simple alternative to Sturges' rule.
* The Rice Rule dictates the number of bars to be floor(2 * cubic root of number of data points).
* It uses device pixel ratio to support screens with high DPI.
* It is responsive on smaller or larger screens.
